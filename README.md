 # Geospatial Fortran Code for Visualizing GRACE Data
 
Here are Fortran code to generate estimates of geophysical parameters from GRACE spherical harmonic fields, for points and/or regions of the Earth. The GRACE fields can be computed to generated estimates of change in geoid height, changes in load in terms of equivalent water height or in terms of elastic or viscoelastic deformation of the surface of the Earth. Time series can be generated at single points or for defined regions.
